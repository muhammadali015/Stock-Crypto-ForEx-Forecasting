       EXTENDED FINTECH FORECASTING DASHBOARD - TECHNICAL REPORT
================================================================================

1. INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Extended FinTech Forecasting Dashboard predicts prices for stocks, 
cryptocurrencies, and forex using LSTM neural networks with adaptive learning.
System continuously updates models to improve prediction accuracy over time.

Key Modules: Data Ingestion (price data collection/preprocessing), Model 
Training (LSTM/GRU/Transformer with 60-step sequences), Prediction 
Visualization (interactive candlestick charts), Portfolio Management 
(simulated trading based on predictions).

Architecture: Flask backend (Python) + React frontend connected via RESTful 
APIs. SQLite database stores models, forecasts, metrics, portfolio data. 
LSTM configuration: sequence_length=60, hidden_units=50, dropout=0.2.


2. ADAPTIVE / CONTINUOUS LEARNING MECHANISM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Three adaptive strategies: (1) Incremental Update - fine-tunes weights with 
new batches, (2) Fine-tuning - lower learning rate (10%) for gradual adaptation,
(3) Full Retraining - complete rebuild when performance degrades.

Retraining Triggers: Time-based (scheduled every N hours, default: 24h), 
Performance-based (MAPE > 5.0% threshold), Data drift detection (performance 
degradation ratio > 1.5x historical average), Rolling window (maintains last 
100 data points).

Retraining Workflow: Monitor incoming data → Calculate metrics (RMSE, MAE, 
MAPE) → If trigger conditions met → Load new data → Apply learning strategy 
(incremental/fine_tune/retrain) → Validate on holdout set → If validation 
improves, deploy new version and save to model_versions table, else keep 
previous version. Model versioning enables rollback capability.


3. EVALUATION AND MONITORING APPROACH
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Metrics: RMSE (prediction magnitude errors), MAE (average absolute deviation),
MAPE (percentage-based errors), Directional Accuracy (% correct up/down 
predictions), 95% Confidence Intervals using prediction variance.

Evaluation Process: ContinuousEvaluator compares predictions vs actuals when 
ground-truth available. Calculates individual errors (|predicted - actual|), 
stores in prediction_errors table with timestamps. Aggregates metrics over 
evaluation window (last 30 predictions).

Visualization: Error overlays (red dotted line on chart showing magnitude),
Performance dashboard (real-time metric cards), Trend analysis (historical 
metric trends), Overall weighted score (0-100 combining all metrics).

Monitoring Dashboard: Accuracy trends (RMSE/MAE over time), Error bands 
(acceptable vs anomalous), Retrain status (last/next scheduled time),
Degradation alerts (MAPE > threshold), Anomaly detection (3-sigma from mean).


4. PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT STRATEGY AND PERFORMANCE VISUALIZATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trading Strategies: SimplePredictionStrategy buys when predicted_return > 2%,
sells when < -2%, holds if confidence < 0.7. Allocates 10% portfolio value per
trade. MomentumStrategy analyzes 5-period momentum + prediction alignment.

Visualization Components: (1) Candle Charts with overlays: green/red candles,
cyan dashed forecast line, cyan confidence interval area, purple portfolio 
value line, red error dots. (2) Portfolio Growth Chart: separate area chart 
showing value over time with gradient fill and tooltips. (3) Risk Metrics: 
Total Value, Return %, Sharpe Ratio, Volatility, Unrealized PnL.

Portfolio Operations: Buy (validates funds, updates positions), Sell 
(validates quantity, realizes PnL), Hold (strategy-based decision), 
Transaction History (all trades recorded with timestamps).


5. SAMPLE RUNS AND VISUALIZATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Candlestick Chart: Historical prices as candlesticks, forecast line 
extending 24h ahead (dashed cyan), confidence interval shaded region, 
portfolio value overlay (purple), volume histogram at bottom, interactive 
legend.

Portfolio Growth Chart: Area chart with portfolio value progression, starting 
at initial capital ($10,000), growth trajectory with gradient, milestones 
for major trades/drawdowns. Y-axis: currency, X-axis: dates.

Performance Metrics Dashboard: Four cards showing RMSE (2.6871 - Good), MAE 
(1.5775 - Good), MAPE (2.99% - Good), Directional Accuracy (73.7% - 
Excellent). Progress bar for directional accuracy (74% filled). Overall 
Performance: 70/100 (Good).

Portfolio Panel: Key metrics ($100,000 total value, 0.00% return, Sharpe 0.00,
Volatility 0%), Current positions (BTC-USD 100 @ $150, $15,000 value), Trading
actions (quantity input + Buy/Sell buttons), Transaction history (recent 
trades listed chronologically).


6. CONCLUSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
System successfully integrates adaptive learning, continuous evaluation, and 
portfolio management. Models automatically adapt via incremental updates, 
fine-tuning, and scheduled retraining. Comprehensive metrics provide 
multi-dimensional performance assessment. Dual visualization (overlay + 
separate chart) correlates forecasts with portfolio performance.

Future Improvements: (1) Reinforcement Learning agents replacing rule-based
strategies, (2) Multi-asset optimization using modern portfolio theory, 
(3) Real-time WebSocket data streaming, (4) Advanced ensemble methods 
(stacking/boosting), (5) Explainable AI (SHAP values/attention), 
(6) Backtesting framework for strategy validation. System demonstrates robust 
foundation for algorithmic trading combining adaptive neural networks with 
continuous evaluation and portfolio management.
