CS4063 - FinTech Data Curation: Critical Analysis of Minimal Predictive Features

The Challenge: Why Not Everything Matters

When building predictive models for financial markets, the temptation is to throw everything at the wall and hope something sticks. However, after analyzing decades of financial research and market behavior, I've identified that most features are noise, not signal. The key insight is that markets are driven by two fundamental forces: information flow and market microstructure effects. My minimal feature set directly captures these drivers.

Strategic Feature Selection: The Logic Behind Each Choice

Structured Data: The Market's DNA
OHLCV Data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)
- These aren't just numbers—they're the market's heartbeat. Each tells a story about supply/demand dynamics.
- Close prices represent the market's final judgment after all information is processed.
- High/Low capture intraday volatility and sentiment extremes.
- Volume reveals the conviction behind price moves—low volume suggests weak hands, high volume indicates strong conviction.

Technical Indicators: The Market's Psychology
Daily Return: This is where the rubber meets the road. It's not just a percentage—it's the market's emotional response to new information. Research shows that momentum effects persist for 1-3 days before mean reversion kicks in.

5-Day Volatility: This isn't just risk measurement—it's a leading indicator. When volatility spikes, it often precedes major moves. It's the market's way of saying "something big is coming."

Moving Averages (5-day, 10-day): These capture the market's memory. When price is above the MA, it suggests upward momentum; below suggests downward pressure. The 5-day captures short-term sentiment, while 10-day provides trend context.

Volume Z-Score: This is the "smart money" detector. When volume spikes (high z-score), it often means institutional players are positioning for something. This signal typically leads price by 1-2 days.

Unstructured Data: The Information Edge
News Count: This measures market attention. More news = more uncertainty = higher volatility. It's a proxy for information flow intensity.

Sentiment Score (VADER): This captures the emotional tone of information. Positive sentiment can drive buying pressure; negative sentiment drives selling. Even crude sentiment analysis adds predictive value over pure technical indicators.

Why This Minimal Set Works: The Science Behind the Selection

1. Information Processing Theory
Markets are information-processing machines. They digest news, adjust prices, and then move on. My features capture both the information (news sentiment) and the processing (price/volume dynamics).

2. Behavioral Finance Insights
- Momentum: People extrapolate recent trends (daily returns, MAs)
- Overreaction: Volatility spikes often precede reversals
- Attention: News count drives trading activity
- Herding: Volume z-scores reveal when institutions are moving

3. Market Microstructure
- Liquidity: Volume patterns reveal market depth
- Price Discovery: OHLC data shows how information gets incorporated
- Order Flow: Volume z-scores indicate institutional vs. retail activity

The Critical Test: Why Not More Features?

Why not 50-day moving averages? Because they're too slow—by the time they signal, the move is over.

Why not RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands? Because they're derived from the same price data I already have. Adding them creates multicollinearity without new information.

Why not more sophisticated sentiment analysis? Because headline sentiment is already noisy—adding complexity doesn't improve signal-to-noise ratio.

Why not macroeconomic indicators? Because they're too slow and affect all assets similarly—they don't help with individual stock prediction.

The Bottom Line: Less is More

This minimal set works because it captures the essential drivers of next-day price movement:
1. Momentum (daily returns, MAs)
2. Risk (volatility)
3. Attention (news count)
4. Sentiment (news polarity)
5. Participation (volume patterns)

Each feature adds unique information. Together, they provide a complete picture of market dynamics without the curse of dimensionality that plagues most financial models.
